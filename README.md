# Market-basket-analysis
This project shows how you can predict which items a shopper will purchase whether they buy it again or recommend to try for the first time.

The link for the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data

This dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, it provides between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. It also provided the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.

This project comes under the domain of Big data with Spark implemented in the databricks environment.

The languages used are Python and SQL. I have used Amazon S3 bucket to load the data into databricks file storage.

I have used data mining technique called FPM(Frequency pattern Mining). I used FP-Growth algorithm for analysing the frequency of the items purchased by the customers.

The complete project can be best viewed under databricks cloud server. The link to access is given below

Anyone with this link can import the whole project into databricks cloud notebook and perform analysis on the data. I completed my whole project in the databricks cloud notebook. 

I'm uploading the ipynb file, but if you need to run the ipynb file on the jupyter notebook follow the link : https://naomi-fridman.medium.com/install-pyspark-to-run-on-jupyter-notebook-on-windows-4ec2009de21f
